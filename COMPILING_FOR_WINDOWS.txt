== How to create Windows binaries using mingw33 (compiling Windows binaries on Linux system):

NOTE: This does not explain how you build Windows binaries on Windows host.

1) Make sure you have mingw32 toolchain installed. On Arch Linux it's mingw-w64 (select complete group)

2) Run "EZ_CONFIG_FILE=.config_windows make" (you can add -j5 to make to build in parallell. Use nbr of cpu cores +1)
   without the quotes.

3) You should get an ezquake.exe :-)
