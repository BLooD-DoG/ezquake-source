How to compile on OSX 10.10:

Get Homebrew: http://brew.sh

Run exactly as it says on the front page:
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

Make sure you run the 'brew doctor' as instructed before doing anything else.

Then run:

brew install sdl2 sdl2_net sdl2_image sdl2_gfx sdl2_mixer pcre

When it's done, just hit make and it should compile without errors
